In Stock Market Prediction, the aim is to predict the future value of the financial stocks of a company. stock market prediction technologies is the use of machine learning which makes predictions based on the values of current stock market indices by training on their previous values. 
Machine learning itself employs different models to make prediction easier and authentic. The Project focuses on the use of LSTM based Machine learning to predict stock values.
the objective of our project is to develop a system that predicts the stock market prices to make more informed and accurate investment decisions which uses historical financial data and market indicators to forecast future stock prices, which enables investors and traders to make informed decisions and maximize their returns.
the outcome of our project is that the model can predict the trend of the actual stock prices very closely with the help of the graph. The accuracy of the model can be enhanced by training with more data and increasing the LSTM layers.
